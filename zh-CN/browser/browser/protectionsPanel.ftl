## In the protections panel, Content Blocking category items are in three sections:
##   "Blocked" for categories being blocked in the current page,
##   "Allowed" for categories detected but not blocked in the current page, and
##   "None Detected" for categories not detected in the current page.
##   These strings are used in the header labels of each of these sections.

## In the Site Not Working? view, we suggest turning off protections if
## the user is experiencing issues with any of a variety of functionality.
