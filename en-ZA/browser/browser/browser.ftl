## The main browser window's title

# attributes are used when the web content opened has no title:

# default - "Mozilla Firefox"
# private - "Mozilla Firefox (Private Browsing)"
#
# The last two are for use when there *is* a content title.
# Variables:
#  $content-title (String): the title of the web content.
