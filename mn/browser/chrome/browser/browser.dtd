<!-- Tab context menu -->


<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (closeTabsToTheEnd.label): This should indicate the
direction in which tabs are closed, i.e. locales that use RTL mode should say
left instead of right. -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pinTab.label, unpinTab.label): "Pin" is being
used as a metaphor for expressing the fact that these tabs are "pinned" to the
left edge of the tabstrip. Really we just want the string to express the idea
that this is a lightweight and reversible action that keeps your tab where you
can reach it easily. -->

     sentence to their language. -->

     exitDOMFullscreenMac.button): the "escape" button on PC keyboards
     is uppercase, while on Mac keyboards it is lowercase -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pointerlockWarning.beforeDomain.label,
     pointerlockWarning.afterDomain.label): these two strings are used
     respectively before and after the domain requiring pointerlock.
     Localizers can use one of them, or both, to better adapt this
     sentence to their language. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (customizeMenu.addToOverflowMenu.label,
     customizeMenu.pinToOverflowMenu.label, customizeMenu.unpinFromOverflowMenu.label)
     The overflow menu is the menu that appears if you click the chevron (>> button)
     in the location bar. These labels are only used in Photon, where you can put
     items into this menu permanently (pinned). -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (customizeMenu.moveToPanel.accesskey, customizeMenu.pinToOverflowMenu.accesskey)
     can appear on the same context menu as menubarCmd and personalbarCmd,
     so they should have different access keys. customizeMenu.moveToToolbar and
     customizeMenu.moveToPanel are mutually exclusive, so can share access
     keys.  -->

    app (hamburger) menu. When clicked, it opens a subview that contains

     search providers:  "Search for <used typed keywords> with:" -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchWithHeader.label):
     The wording of this string should be as close as possible to
     searchFor.label and searchWith.label. This string will be used instead of
     them when the user has not typed any keyword. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (changeSearchSettings.button):
     This string won't wrap, so if the translated string is longer,
     consider translating it as if it said only "Search Settings". -->

<!-- Media (video/audio) controls -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: The access keys for "Play" and

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (pluginNotification.width): This is used to determine the
     width of the plugin popup notification that can appear if a plugin has been
     blocked on a page. Should be wide enough to fit the pluginActivateNow.label

     a CSS length value. -->


<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (panicButton.view.mainTimeframeDesc, panicButton.view.5min, panicButton.view.2hr, panicButton.view.day):
     The .mainTimeframeDesc string combined with any of the 3 others is meant to form a complete sentence, e.g. "Forget the last: Five minutes".

     The translation should do the same. -->
