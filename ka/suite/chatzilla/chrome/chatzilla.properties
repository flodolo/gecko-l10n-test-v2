### Notes for localizers ###
#
# ChatZilla uses cmd.<command name>.* to construct the command's help,
# parameters and any UI labels. For the command to continue to function, the
# *.params entries MUST NOT BE CHANGED. Hopefully in the future you will be
# able to localize these items as well.
#
### DO NOT LOCALIZE THE *.params STRINGS ###
#
# Note also that, for every command, an accesskey may be specified:
#   EITHER by prefixing the desired accesskey with "&" in the .label string,
#   OR     by specifying a .accesskey string, which is useful if the desired
#          accesskey does not occur in the label.
#
# The following are therefore equivalent:
#    cmd.foo.label = &Foo
# and
#    cmd.foo.label = Foo
#    cmd.foo.accesskey = F
#
#
# All localised strings may contain certain entities for branding purposes.
# The three standard brand entities (brandShortName, brandFullName, vendorName)
# can all be used like this:
#     foo.bar = Some text used in &brandFullName;!
#
