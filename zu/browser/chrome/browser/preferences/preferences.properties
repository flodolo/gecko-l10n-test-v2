# LOCALIZATION NOTE (mozNameTemplate): This template constructs the name of the
# block list in the block lists dialog. It combines the list name and
# description.
#   e.g. mozNameTemplate : "Standard (Recommended). This list does a pretty good job."
#   %1$S = list name (fooName), %2$S = list descriptive text (fooDesc)
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (mozstdName, etc.): These labels appear in the tracking
# protection block lists dialog, mozNameTemplate is used to create the final
# string. Note that in the future these two strings (name, desc) could be
# displayed on two different lines.
