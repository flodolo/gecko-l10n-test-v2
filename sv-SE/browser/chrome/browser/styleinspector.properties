# LOCALIZATION NOTE (rule.showUnmatchedLink): Each style property
# is inside a rule. A rule is a selector that can match (or not) the highlighted

# the link displayed at the bottom of the rules table. That link shows how many
# rules are not displayed. This is the string used when the link is generated.
