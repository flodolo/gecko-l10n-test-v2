<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (tabCrashed.header2): "Gah" is an English slang word
     used to express surprise or frustration (or both at the same time).  We
     are using it to communicate in an informal way that it is both
     frustrating that your tab crashed and a surprise that we didn't want to
     happen. If you have a similar word or short phrase that is not profane or
     vulgar, use it. If not, feel free to skip the word in your
     translation. -->
