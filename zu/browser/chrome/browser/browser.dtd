<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (pinTab.label, unpinTab.label): "Pin" is being
used as a metaphor for expressing the fact that these tabs are "pinned" to the
left edge of the tabstrip. Really we just want the string to express the idea
that this is a lightweight and reversible action that keeps your tab where you
can reach it easily. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (customizeMenu.addToOverflowMenu.label,
     customizeMenu.pinToOverflowMenu.label, customizeMenu.unpinFromOverflowMenu.label)
     The overflow menu is the menu that appears if you click the chevron (>> button)
     in the location bar. These labels are only used in Photon, where you can put
     items into this menu permanently (pinned). -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (customizeMenu.moveToPanel.accesskey, customizeMenu.pinToOverflowMenu.accesskey)
     can appear on the same context menu as menubarCmd and personalbarCmd,
     so they should have different access keys. customizeMenu.moveToToolbar and
     customizeMenu.moveToPanel are mutually exclusive, so can share access
     keys.  -->

    app (hamburger) menu. When clicked, it opens a subview that contains
    secondary commands. -->

<!--
  Comment duplicated from browser-sets.inc:

  Search Command Key Logic works like this:

  Unix: Ctrl+J (0.8, 0.9 support)
        Ctrl+K (cross platform binding)
  Mac:  Cmd+K (cross platform binding)
        Cmd+Opt+F (platform convention)
  Win:  Ctrl+K (cross platform binding)
        Ctrl+E (IE compat)

  We support Ctrl+K on all platforms now and advertise it in the menu since it is
  our standard - it is a "safe" choice since it is near no harmful keys like "W" as
  "E" is. People mourning the loss of Ctrl+K for emacs compat can switch their GTK
  system setting to use emacs emulation, and we should respect it. Focus-Search-Box
  is a fundamental keybinding and we are maintaining a XP binding so that it is easy
  for people to switch to Linux.

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (contentSearchInput.label):
     This is set as the aria-label attribute for the search input box in the
     in-content search UI, to be used by screen readers. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchInput.placeholder):
     This string is displayed in the search box when the input field is empty. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchFor.label, searchWith.label):
     These two strings are used to build the header above the list of one-click
     search providers:  "Search for <used typed keywords> with:" -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchWithHeader.label):
     The wording of this string should be as close as possible to
     searchFor.label and searchWith.label. This string will be used instead of
     them when the user has not typed any keyword. -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (changeSearchSettings.button):
     This string won't wrap, so if the translated string is longer,
     consider translating it as if it said only "Search Settings". -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (pluginNotification.width): This is used to determine the
     width of the plugin popup notification that can appear if a plugin has been
     blocked on a page. Should be wide enough to fit the pluginActivateNow.label

     a CSS length value. -->

     The .mainTimeframeDesc string combined with any of the 3 others is meant to form a complete sentence, e.g. "Forget the last: Five minutes".
     Please ensure that this remains the case in the translation. -->



<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE: (panicButton.view.mainLabel, panicButton.view.deleteCookies, panicButton.view.deleteHistory, panicButton.view.deleteTabsAndWindows, panicButton.view.openNewWindow):
     The .mainActionDesc string combined with any of the 4 others is meant to form a complete sentence, e.g. "Proceeding will: Delete Recent Cookies".
     Note also that the deleteCookies, deleteHistory and deleteTabsAndWindows strings include <html:strong> tags for emphasis on the words "Cookies", "History", "Tabs" and "Windows".
     The translation should do the same. -->
